*Download pretrained checkpoint from [Stylegan](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) and convert the tensorflow checkpoint to pytorch. Put checkpoints in the folder of **./datasetGAN/dataset_release/stylegan_pretrain***.

Note: a good example of converting stylegan tensorlow checkpoint to pytorch is available this [Link](https://github.com/lernapparat/lernapparat/blob/master/style_gan/pytorch_style_gan.ipynb).

## Training 

To reproduce paper **DatasetGAN: Efficient Labeled Data Factory with Minimal Human Effort**: 

```
cd datasetGAN
```

1. Run **Step1: Interpreter training**.  
3. Run **Step2: Sampling** to generate massive annotation-image dataset.
4. Run **Step3: Train Downstream Task**.



#### 1. Interpreter Training 

```
python train_interpreter.py --exp experiments/<exp_name>.json 
```

Note: Training time for 16 images is around one hour. 160G RAM is required to run 16 images training. One can cache the data returned from **prepare_data** function to disk but it will increase trianing time due to I/O burden. 

*Example of annotation schema for Face class. Please refer to paper for other classes.*

#### 2. Run GAN Sampling  

```
python train_interpreter.py \
--generate_data True --exp experiments/<exp_name>.json  \
--resume [path-to-trained-interpreter in step3] \
--num_sample [num-samples]
```
To run sampling processes in parallel
```
sh datasetGAN/script/generate_face_dataset.sh
```

*Example of sampling images and annotation:*

#### 3. Train Downstream Task  

```
python train_deeplab.py \
--data_path [path-to-generated-dataset in step4] \
--exp experiments/<exp_name>.json
```

## Inference

![img](./figs/datasetgan_demo.png)



```
python test_deeplab_cross_validation.py --exp experiments/face_34.json\
--resume [path-to-downstream task checkpoint] --cross_validate True
```

**June 21st Update:**

For training interpreter, we change the upsampling method from nearnest upsampling to bilinar upsampling in [line](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/datasetGAN_release/blob/release_finallll/datasetGAN/train_interpreter.py#L163) and update results in Table 1.  The table reports mIOU.
